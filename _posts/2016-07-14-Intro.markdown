The League of Legends Kill Stats extension creates a new "kill timeline" tab on the LoL match history page. This extension parses timeline
data to create a clean and easy to read chart of kill events that happen during the selected game.

The kill timeline chart can be used to quickly gather data about your performance in game and can serve as a roadmap for
viewing game replays.

Enjoy!
